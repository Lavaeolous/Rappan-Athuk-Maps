# State of this project
My Rappan Athuk campaign is winding down after 3-4 years. We will skip large parts of Rappan Athuk to venture towards new adventures in PF2e. As such, work on Rappan Athuk maps will wind down as well, i simply do not have that much time left. I the muse strikes i will add new maps now and then, but do not depend on that.

# Notes
Some Maps may use additional asset packs, which you will need to source yourself if you plan on working with the dungeondraft files.

# Change Log

### 2023_10_15
* Added dimensions in squares for each map to this readme

### 2023_04_15
* I had to reset the repository and remove the commit history, as i ran over githubs free storage limit. I removed intermediary files from the repository for this reason as well, as these were rather large, especially as i saved them as uncompressed pngs.
