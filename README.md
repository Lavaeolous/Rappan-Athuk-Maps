# Additional Assets used
Some Assets may be activated in the DungeonDraft File but not really used. Sorry for that. If a map does not denote additional assets, it was created using the default DungeonDraft Assets only.

# Change Log
### 2023_04_15
* I had to reset the repository and remove the commit history, as i ran over githubs free storage limit. I removed intermediary files from the repository for this reason as well, as these were rather large, especially as i saved them as uncompressed pngs.
