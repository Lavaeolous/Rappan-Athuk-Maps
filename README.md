# Additional Assets used
Some Assets may be activated in the DungeonDraft File but not really used. Sorry for that. If a map does not denote additional assets, it was created using the default DungeonDraft Assets only.

# Change Log
### 2021.01.11
*  Added a custom map for tunnels connecting to the Troll Mound, as my players may be captured by Turane and the Trolls in an upcoming session and i've found the Troll Mound to be to large to allow for a believable "prison break" scene.
*  The Troll Mound is blocked out but needs further refinement, e.g. clutter and stuff
